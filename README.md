#Linear Algebra Project

This project is a final capstone for my Linear Algebra courses in university. This project will ideally be able to 
perform almost all the operations I learned during my two Linear Algebra courses. The software is currently in C++ becuase
I originally wanted the practice of using pointers, learning C++. Ultimately this project could turn into a website similar
to Wolfram Alpha or Octave. 

##TO-DO
- [x] Parse input string -> convert to array
- [x] Create UserMatrix object
    - holds the array (entries)
    - dimensions of the array (m,n)
